          Lineup dictionary crispens up your gameplay by allowing you to quickly look up lineups in the middle of a game. 
          The interface is designed to sit on top of your game and is completely navigable via hotkeys, 
          which are completely customizable and can be used to lookup lineups in a matter of seconds.

	      Patch Notes(10/16/2023):<br>
	      -Added an icon for the executable<br><br>
	      -Mouse pointer no longer teleports into the middle of the screen. Instead, the program blocks the mouse from moving into the window's area.
	      <br><br><br>
	      Patch Notes(7/12/2023):<br>
	      
	      <br>
	      -Enabled the ability for lineups to be downloaded from the internet automatically, so that your Lineup Dictionary always stays up to date!<br><br>
	      -Added a loading screen<br><br>
	      -Added a feature that displays the number of lineups in each directory<br><br>
	      -Made it so that while viewing a specific lineup, it takes 18 seconds for the application to minimize, while the minimization time for browsing the lineups/directories is 6 seconds<br><br>
	      -Reduced the quality of lineup images by making them 5-bit colors rather than 8-bit colors, which helps to save storage space and reduce lineup download times.<br><br>
	      -Added a total of 20 Killjoy lineups, including lineups for ult-molly combos, with the position of the ultimate shown in the first image alongside the white arrow which tells you where to stand.<br><br>
	      -Added more Sova lineups to bring the total up to 50 sova recon lineups.<br><br>
	      -Added a couple more Brimstone lineups.<br><br>
	      -Fixed a bug where the dark mode didn't apply to a couple of the views<br><br>
	      <br><br><br>
	      Older Updates:<br>
	      -Added overlay view so that lineups can be lined up by matching the game's display with the overlay's display<br><br>
	      -Enabled dark mode. No more light mode.<br><br>
	      -Enabled lineup dictionary to be minimized after a certain amount of time
