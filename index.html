      <div class = "description">

          Lineup dictionary crispens up your gameplay by allowing you to quickly look up lineups in the middle of a game. 
          The interface is designed to sit on top of your game and is completely navigable via hotkeys, 
          which are completely customizable and can be used to lookup lineups in a matter of seconds.

	      <br><br>
	      Patch Notes(7/12/2023):<br>
	      Warning! Only use lineup dictionary when there is wifi. Otherwise it will just crash. This is going to get fixed in the future.
	      Added a system so that Lineup Dictionary downloads lineups from the StandardLineups git repository, whenever it detects that the lineups on the user's system are behind the most recent version. 
	      This allows for a smaller download file size, and it let's us update/add lineups to the program without the user having to manually search for the next version to download.
	      <br>
	      Added a loading screen<br>
	      Added a feature that displays the number of lineups in each directory<br>
	      Made it so that while viewing a specific lineup, it takes 18 seconds for the application to minimize, while the minimization time for browsing the lineups/directories is 6 seconds<br>
	      Reduced the quality of lineup images by making them 5-bit colors rather than 8-bit colors, which helps to save storage space and reduce lineup download times.<br>
	      Added a total of 20 Killjoy lineups, including lineups for ult-molly combos, with the position of the ultimate shown in the first image alongside the white arrow which tells you where to stand.<br>
	      Added more Sova lineups to bring the total up to 50 sova recon lineups.<br>
	      Added a couple more Brimstone lineups.<br>
	      Fixed a bug where the dark mode didn't apply to a couple of the views<br>
	      <br><br>
	      Older Updates:<br>
	      Added overlay view so that lineups can be lined up by matching the game's display with the overlay's display<br>
	      Enabled dark mode. No more light mode.<br>
	      Enabled lineup dictionary to be minimized after a certain amount of time
